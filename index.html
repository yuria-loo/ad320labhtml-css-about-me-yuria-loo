        <h4>Bio:</h4>
        <p>
          Rose was surrendered to PAWs at the early age of 1 year and stayed
          there for 5 years until he was adopted by his current owner. He is a
          sweet 13-year-old indoor cat with the energy of a kitten. While not a
          traditionally trained Software Developer, Rose excels at full-stack
          development. He's always willing to perform a code review and give
          honest, actionable feedback. Sadly, his feedback is typically ignored
          as he is a Cat, and no one can understand what he's saying.
